=============
Proposed solutions for [projecteuler](http://projecteuler.net).

All problems should be on the form of `problem_<number>_<author/comment>` and prefixed with contributors, output and estimated complexity (doesn't have to be exact or even correct).

Example:
    # Authors: Nobody
    # Complexity: O(n!)
    # Output: 0
